The application allows users to input their username and password via a form.

Form state management is achieved using the useFormState custom hook, leveraging React Hooks (useState).

Users can interact with the form by entering their username and password. Upon submission, the form data is displayed below the form.

The form logic is modularized within the useFormState custom hook, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
